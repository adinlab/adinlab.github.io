Founded in 2022, our lab exercises fundamental research on learning-based control of adaptive systems. Our mission is to lift the borders between the training time and the usage time of learning agents. In this way, we believe to equip the agents of the future with the ability to perpetually adapt to their users and changing environment conditions throughout their whole life cycle. We define the set of open research questions that hinder real-world use of life-long trainable agents as *the adaptive intelligence problem* and work hard on solving it.
